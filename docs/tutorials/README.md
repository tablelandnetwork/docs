There are a number of written tutorials and [workshops](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAc0xDyQDZbqTNM3lejUkVdiTprS2Gjob) that walk through how to build on Tableland. An endless number of use cases exist for using a serverless and permissionless relational database, but a few common areas include the following:

## NFTs & gaming

Build dynamic NFTs user-driven actions (on-chain) mutating table state.

- [Build a dynamic NFT in Solidity](/tutorials/dynamic-nft-solidity): Get started with the basics of a Solidity-based NFT game that uses SQL queries to create and populate a table of game state.
- [Creating a dynamic NFT with p5.js](/tutorials/dynamic-nft-p5js): Add visual components to the intro tutorial about that walks through building a dynamic NFT in Solidity.
- [Building a game on Arbitrum](<(/tutorials/building-games-on-arbitrum)>): Learn how to build a game of hangman with smart contracts, React, and IPFS.
- [Dynamic NFT with Chainlink](/tutorials/dynamic-nft-chainlink): Use Chainlink oracles to change the visual state of an NFT based on off-chain actions.

## Data & storage

Learn how Tableland can power collaborative data and other data-driven use cases.

- [Building a Data DAO](/tutorials/data-dao-polygon): Create a DAO where only successful DAO votes from members will mutate table data.
- [Key-value store as NFT](/tutorials/data-dao-polygon): Use Tableland as a key-value store while also enabling ownership through an NFT-based database.

## Utility

Miscellaneous walkthroughs that showcase Tableland functionality along with various tools or protocols.

- [JSON files to NFT metadata](/tutorials/dynamic-nft-polygon): With a Hardhat project, take local JSON files, read/parse the data into tables, and then mint an NFT where Tableland powers the metadata.
- [On-chain table reads with Chainlink](/tutorials/dynamic-nft-polygon): Since table state is all off-chain within the Tableland network, you can use oracles like Chainlink to query table data using an API and write that data back on-chain.
